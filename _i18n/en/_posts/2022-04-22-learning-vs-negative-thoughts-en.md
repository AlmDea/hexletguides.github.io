Fitting active and regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult, at first your body will resist: aching muscle pain, fatigue, unwillingness to continue. If you go for a run for the first time in decades, the body will clearly tell you: “you don't need to do this”. This is a natural reaction. An evolutionary defense tool against overloads and hazards.

Any physical exercises or sports classes teach people to cope with this reaction and create their workout routine listening to the body needs.

If you start active and regular mental exercises (for example, learning programming), then at first your brain will be very resistant. The brain has much more resistance tools than the muscles: it can plant thoughts that you're incompetent, that "this is not mine, and it's better for me to do something else," or "I'm not mathematically-minded" and so on.

This article is about the mind’s resistance when faced with problems and overcoming these problems. It consists of four steps:

1. **Realization.** Notice, realize, become a scientist.
2. **Mindset.** Understand what success depends on.
3. **Being open.** Exclude one of the main conditions of mental block.
4. **Progress**. Accept the realities of the learning process.
 
## Step 1: Realization

First of all, it’s necessary to notice and realize the emerging resistance of the mind. Treat your body and mind as a scientific experiment: they give you, the observer, some signals, then they react to actions and environment.

Try to notice or even write down the conditions under which such thoughts typically occur. A lot of factors affect the mental state, including physical condition, work environment, sleep, nutrition, stress, goals, relationships, etc.

Keeping a journal can be a good idea. Write everything about your everyday life: how much you sleep, what do you do, what do you eat, how much do you read, how do you relax and how are your trainings going.

It will be great if you can identify the reasons of good and bad days. Sleeping less than 7 hours plus meeting someone before lunch is almost always correlated with academic failures. Or physical activity and reduced consumption of sweets has something with successful trainings. Perhaps there isn't just a correlation here but a causal link.

Do your own experiments and feel like a scientist.

## Step 2: Mindset

[Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck), Stanford University psychologist, identified two core mindsets: fixed mindset and growth mindset.

Mindset is a collection of beliefs, ideas and concepts that held by oneself.

**Fixed mindset** is characterized by such beliefs:

- I am who I am and people don't change
- success depends on talent which is innate
- people are fixed into clear categories: techies, humanitarians, strong and weak, smart and stupid, etc.
- I should avoid changes and challenges to prevent the possibility of failure
- putting in effort is worthless
- I need to choose a path of least effort
- being criticised is bad
- I have every right to complain about problems and failures

**Growth** **mindset** is characterized by such beliefs:

- I’m able to change, my abilities and intelligence can be developed over time if I put my mind to it
- success can be achieved through effort
- categories of people are more likely approximate descriptions of the current state or areas of interests, they don't define anyone's fate
- I willingly embrace challenges, it’s an opportunity to grow
- effort leads to mastery
- I believe failures are just temporary setbacks and learning opportunities
- constructive feedback as a source of information
- complaints make no sense and distract from the things that really matter

You can notice a recursive trap: fixed mindset makes a person think that his fate is predetermined and he won’t be able to change.

Studies of mindsets lead to an interesting conclusion: the quality of life and satisfaction depend more on a subjective attitude, and *not on talent or intelligence.* In other words, a person is able to develop a growth mindset with beliefs and rational evidence.

Use your emotional resistance ("probably, this is not for me", "it's obvious that I'm not a tech guy...", "I’d never make it as a programmer") as a starting point in your mindset transformation.

Resistance, problems and failures aren’t going anywhere. Any professional who has achieved something has thousands of times more problems and failures than a beginner who has given up. They are distinguished primarily by their attitude to these problems.

Resistance is good. This is a sign of growth. Don't miss the opportunity to grow.

## **Step 3: Being open**

Forget the myth that hard work and tons of books you've read will make you an expert. The shortest way to get into learning stagnation is to isolate yourself from other students and teachers.

1. **Ask questions.** If you learn programming at Hexlet you will get an answer anyway — our mentors answer all questions after each lesson. Formulating a question also helps to sort everything out and bring you closer to a solution. An abstract problem in the head and the one put into text are different things.
2. **Communicate.** You might call yourself an extrovert or an introvert, but every person needs socializing more or less, and this is crucial in studying. It is very helpful to find other people with similar problems of yours, to know about their progress and experience. Hexlet has a [big friendly chat](https://slack-ru.hexlet.io/) for this purpose.
3. **Accept and share your experience.** Find someone who is in similar situation or under identical conditions. Right now someone like you is trying to learn programming or a new language. Someone is experiencing similar difficulties. Read, for example, [Albert's](https://medium.com/@sayoBye) and [Joisa's](https://joisadler.me/) blogs about learning programming. Consider starting your own blog.

## **Step 4: Progress**

The process of exploring new areas can sometimes seem too slow or even endless. In the essay ["The Learning Process"](https://rakh.im/learning/) I had an interesting analogy describing the process of learning new subjects. I recommend you to read it if you ask yourself the same questions:

- Which book should I start with?
- I kind of understood each topic separately, but I simply don't get how they are connected. And why did I even study it, it makes no sense to me.
- I study a lot but that's not really helping!

I also advise you to read Kirill Mokevnin's article on [effective reading of professional literature.](https://ru.hexlet.io/blog/posts/how-to-read-books) 

A temporary lack of visible progress is OK but a long-lasting one is a sign of serious problems. For example, if after six months of learning programming you still can't write and run a simple program, it's about time to make changes to the learning process. Try as soon as possible (it doesn't have to be perfect!) create your own project, application, website, etc.

A good strategy is to keep track of progress by recording your goals, progress and successes. Review it from time to time and compare yourself with your past self. If you find past problems a little funny or you are even a bit [embarrassed](https://hello.rakh.im/how_to_evaluate_personal_growth/) — that's awesome! You've obviously grown up. If the old problems haven't gone away, then it's worth changing the approach, conditions and tools of training.

As it often happens, all such topics can be summed up in a short ancient Greek saying: γνῶθι σεαυτόν — **know yourself**.
